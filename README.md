Project description/outline - New York is one of the most famous cities in the world, known for its towering skyscrapers, famous districts, and endless energy. We found the NYPD Arrest Data (year to date) in the NYPD Open Data and thought of the various NYPD Series and decided to analysed the 2022 NYPD Arrest data. We cleaned the data with Pandas, broke the data by the various boroughs (the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island), by gender, age, months, analyzing each statistic to create different visualizations with matplotlib to determine where the most crime and arrests occured, which age group and gender had the most arrests, the safer months (least number of arrests) and dangerous months (highest number of arrests) in the city of New York in 2022. 

In this analysis, we answered the following research questions: 
1. What is the most common type of offense (Ose)
2. which burrough has the highest number of people arrested/ most dangerous part of NY (Jon A)
3. Which age group is most commonly arrested (Hinna)
4. What month had the highest number of arrests (Ose)
5. Which precinct has made the most arrests (#2 and #6 should correlate with eachother) (Jon A)
6. Gender split among arrests (Hinna)
7. Get specific and find out the worst corner of the city (e.g jane & finch) (John F)
8. overall percentage of type of crime (John F)
